# GitLink Demo

Data teams want to use Git to version control their data models, and adopt engineering practices to better control, review, and deploy data. GitLink is Census' way to integrate Census into the Git-based workflows of many Modern Data Stack teams, by allowing Census to version control all changes through Git. Data teams will now also be able to interact with Census via Git as well, which is much more integrated into existing workflows.
